# CODE:RARE - Social Media Platform

The Rose Project presents a Social Media app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Check it out: https://roseylikeme.github.io/code-rare/

## Description + Goal

The Rose Project presents to you Code:RARE. With this particular project, my goal is to showcase my understanding of CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations through a social media website. This website is powered by the Code Rare Servers API -> https://code-rare-servers-923a148ef3c1.herokuapp.com/.

This website has four simple pages:
- Login page
- Register page
- Home (Post) page
- Profile Page

### Sign In & Register Page

To start, we have a simple sign-in page that greets you as you enter. We also have a registration page to create new users.

### Posts Page
Once a user is signed in, they will be redirected to the posts page. Here, you could see all the posts created by other users, a side nav bar that allows you to navigate to the profile page, as well as a text area input box that allows you to create a post.

### Profile Page
At the profile page, you will see only posts created by the current user. Another thing unique about this page is that you will get to see your user bio, which you are able to update.
